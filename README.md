## Trade Broadcast Server

Sample server in Akka/Netty   that gets quote data from upstream and broadcasts it to multiple downstream clients

Use the following command in your tty: telnet localhost 5556

## ps

This small project was a programming task. I am by no means a Scala (or Akka) fan, in fact I'd rather avoid the languages with that level of magic and complexity, especially because the better alternatives do exist.
